## Problem Statement 

To establish a dashboard containg banking dataset using chatgpt and then to draw out insights from it. 

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Go to Perplexity and write prompt to give 10,000 records dataset.It gave three tables "Customers" ,"Acccounts" and "Transactions"
- Step 2 : Since it gave three different tables so write a prompt to join these tables by putting each table's heading. It gave left join query and combined table is named as "CombinedTransactions1"
- Step 3 : Also, write prompt to fix date fromat from "19-05-1999" to "19/05/1999".
- Step 3 : Loaded the data in power Bi.
- Step 4 : Also, ask from Perplexity I want to create two page report to be created in Power Bi.Give me Description,KPI,chart,DAX by copy pasting the column heading of "CombinedTransactions1"
- Step 5 : Column heading can be generated by using below query in SQL
```bash
                     select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where TABLE_NAME like 'CombinedTransactions1'

- Step 6 : Click on "Transform Data" tab in Power Bi tab to see data type of each column and change it to "Text","Decimal","Alphabet" etc according to column needs.Also, do data cleaning i.e removing duplictes, 'replace' null to 'unknown'.
- Step 7 : Whhile changing data type of dates column it is showing "ERROR" therefore choose "Use Locale" from dropdown then "Data Type" = Date and "Locale" = English(US).

- Step 8 : In first page a rectangle containing "Transaction Overview" as text is put from Insert--> Shape option from Power Bi. 
- Step 9 : Creating a card visual "Total transaction Count" using DAX formula suggested by Perplexity.
 ```bash
                   Total Transactions = COUNT(CombinedTransactions1[TransactionID])
 ```

- Step 10 : Creating a card visual "Total Amount" using DAX formula suggested by Perplexity.
```bash
                 Total Amount = SUM(CombinedTransactions1[Amount])
```
- Step 11 : Creating a card visual "Transaction per Customer" using DAX formula suggested by Perplexity.
```bash
                  Txns per Customer = DIVIDE([Total Transactions], [Active Customers], 0)
```
