## Problem Statement 

To establish a dashboard containg banking dataset using chatgpt and then to draw out insights from it. 

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Go to Perplexity and write prompt to give 10,000 records dataset.It gave three tables "Customers" ,"Acccounts" and "Transactions"
- Step 2 : Since it gave three different tables so write a prompt to join these tables by putting each table's heading. It gave left join query and combined table is named as "CombinedTransactions1"
- Step 3 : Also, write prompt to fix date fromat from "19-05-1999" to "19/05/1999".
- Step 3 : Loaded the data in power Bi.
- Step 4 : Also, ask from Perplexity I want to create two page report to be created in Power Bi.Give me Description,KPI,chart,DAX by copy pasting the column heading of "CombinedTransactions1"
- Step 5 : Column heading can be generated by using below query in SQL
```bash
                     select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where TABLE_NAME like 'CombinedTransactions1'

- Step 6 : Click on "Transform Data" tab in Power Bi tab to see data type of each column and change it to "Text","Decimal","Alphabet" etc according to column needs.Also, do data cleaning i.e removing duplictes, 'replace' null to 'unknown'.
- Step 7 : Whhile changing data type of dates column it is showing "ERROR" therefore choose "Use Locale" from dropdown then "Data Type" = Date and "Locale" = English(US).

- Step 8 : In first page a rectangle containing "Transaction Overview" as text is put from Insert--> Shape option from Power Bi. 
- Step 9 : Creating a card visual "Total transaction Count" using DAX formula suggested by Perplexity.
 ```bash
                   Total Transactions = COUNT(CombinedTransactions1[TransactionID])
 ```

- Step 10 : Creating a card visual "Total Amount" using DAX formula suggested by Perplexity.
```bash
                 Total Amount = SUM(CombinedTransactions1[Amount])
```
- Step 11 : Creating a card visual "Transaction per Customer" using DAX formula suggested by Perplexity.
```bash
                  Txns per Customer = DIVIDE([Total Transactions], [Active Customers], 0)
```
-Step 12 : Creating a line visual "Average Balance By Account Id" using DAX formula suggested by Perplexity.

```

-Step 13 : Creating a clusture column visual "Active Customer by Gender" using DAX formula suggested by Perplexity.
```bash
                  Active Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(CombinedTransactions1[CustomerID])
```

-Step 14 : Creating a clustured column visual "Top 3 Customer Amount By CustomerId" using DAX formula suggested by Perplexity.
```bash
                 Top Customer Amount = SUM(CombinedTransactions1[Amount])
```
-Step 15 : Creating a line visual "Sum of Amount and Count of TransactionID by Month" by creating using "Amount" and "Transactionid" suggested by Perplexity.

-Step 16 : Creating a clustured column visual "Distinct Customer Count by Gender" using DAX suggested by Perplexity.
```bash
                 Customer Count by Gender = DISTINCTCOUNT(CombinedTransactions1[Gender])
```

-Step 17 : Creating two column one customer age and other customer age group.Create stacked column chart "Count Of Customer ID By Age Group" suggested by Perplexity showin different age group.
```bash
                Customer Age = DATEDIFF(CombinedTransactions1[DateOfBirth], TODAY(), YEAR)
                Customer Age Group = SWITCH(TRUE(), [Customer Age]<=25, "â‰¤25", [Customer Age]<=35, "26-35", [Customer Age]<=50,"36-50","51+")
```

-Step 18 : Creating a treemap visual "Account Count By Account Type" using DAX suggested by Perplexity.
```bash
                Account Count by Type = COUNT(CombinedTransactions1[AccountID])
```

-Step 18 : Creating a stacked column visual "Count of Acoount By Open Date" suggested by Perplexity.
-Step 19 : Creating a line visual "Total Transaction By Month" using DAX suggested by Perplexity.
```bash
               Transactions by Month = CALCULATE(COUNT(CombinedTransactions1[TransactionID]), ALLEXCEPT(CombinedTransactions1, CombinedTransactions1[TransactionDate].[Month]))
```

# Insights

A two page report is created and it was published in power bi services.

Following inferences can be drawn from the Report;

# Customer Behavior & Engagement
High Transaction Volume: With 10K transactions and 2.50K transactions per customer, engagement is strong. This suggests customers are actively using services, which is a positive indicator of retention.

Monthly Stability: The Count of TransactionID line shows consistent activity (750–850/month), indicating a stable customer base and predictable revenue flow.

# Financial Performance
Total Amount Processed: ₹28.83M in transactions is substantial. However, the Average Balance by AccountID chart reveals negative balances (e.g., AccountID 102 at -157.87K), which may signal overdrafts, credit usage, or financial stress among certain segments.

Top Customer Contributions: CustomerID 3 contributes positively (₹0.25M), while CustomerIDs 2 and 4 show negative amounts. This imbalance suggests a need to evaluate customer profitability and credit risk.

# Customer Demographics
Gender Distribution: Equal split among Female, Male, and Unknown (33.33% each).

Age Groups: Uniform distribution across 26–35, 36–50, and 51+ (100 customers each).

Insight: The equal distribution suggests either a synthetic dataset or a need to validate data diversity. Consider adding filters or slicers to explore real demographic skews.

# Account Insights
Account Type: Balanced count between Current and Savings accounts (200 each).

Open Dates: Four distinct dates with equal account counts (100 each).

Suggestion: A timeline or cumulative account growth chart could better reveal trends in account openings over time.

# Transaction Trends
Monthly Transactions: Fairly consistent, with slight peaks in October and December (868 each), and dips in February (756).

Opportunity: Highlight seasonal patterns or promotional impacts. A year-over-year comparison could add depth.
